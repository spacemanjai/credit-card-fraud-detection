**# credit-card-fraud-detection**

**Overview**

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression. The dataset used is a subset of credit card transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent examples, and the workflow covers data preprocessing, balancing, model training, and evaluation.

**Features**

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Handling class imbalance using under-sampling

Feature-target split and train-test split

Data scaling with StandardScaler

Model training using logistic regression

Model evaluation using accuracy metrics

**Dataset**

The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions with the following features:

Time: Seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction

V1-V28: Principal components obtained with PCA

Amount: Transaction amount

Class: Target variable (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraudulent)

**Model Performance**

Training Accuracy: 97.6%

Test Accuracy: 95.2%
